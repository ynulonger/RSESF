# Rotation-Scale Equivariant Steerable Filters 

This repository is the official **PyTorch** implementation of Medical Imaging with Deep Learning (MIDL) paper "Rotation-Scale Equivariant Steerable Filters" by Yilong Yang, Srinandan Dasmahapatra and Sasan Mahmoodi. This is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that is robust to rotation, scaling, and translation transformation. The implementation is partially based on [SESN](https://github.com/ISosnovik/sesn), [RotDCF](https://github.com/ZichenMiao/RotDCF), [DCF-Net](https://github.com/ZeWang95/DCFNet-Pytorch), [RST-CNN](https://github.com/gaoliyao/Roto-scale-translation-Equivariant-CNN), and [N-Jet](https://github.com/SilviaLauraPintea/N-JetNet). Please refer to our paper for official references.
